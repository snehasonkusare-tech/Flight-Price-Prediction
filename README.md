✈️ Flight Price Prediction

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict flight ticket prices based on various factors such as airline, date of journey, source and destination, route details, duration, and total stops. The model helps stakeholders, including airlines and travel agencies, optimize pricing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes the following key features:

🛫 Airline: The airline operating the flight.

📅 Date of Journey: The date on which the journey is scheduled.

🌍 Source and Destination Cities: Departure and arrival locations.

🛤️ Route Details: The path taken by the flight, including layovers.

⏰ Departure and Arrival Times: The times at which the flight departs and arrives.

⏳ Duration: Total flight duration.

🔀 Total Stops: Number of stops between source and destination.

ℹ️ Additional Flight Info: Extra details that might impact the pricing.

💲 Actual Ticket Price: The target variable for prediction.

🛠️ Implementation Steps

📥 Data Collection:

Data was sourced from reliable flight booking platforms.

The dataset was cleaned to remove missing or duplicate values.

📌 Data Preprocessing:

Converted categorical variables (Airline, Source, Destination, etc.) into numerical format using one-hot encoding.

Extracted useful features such as day, month, and year from the date of journey.

Normalized numerical features like flight duration.

Handled missing values and outliers.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Used visualizations (📈 histograms, 📊 boxplots, 📉 scatter plots) to understand data distributions.

Identified key trends, such as the impact of weekdays vs. weekends on flight prices.

🤖 Model Development:

Implemented machine learning models including:

📏 Linear Regression

🌲 Random Forest Regressor

🚀 Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)

Evaluated models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-Squared Score.

⚙️ Model Evaluation & Tuning:

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

Compared performance metrics and selected the best model.

📌 Outcome & Insights:

The 🌲 Random Forest Regressor and 🚀 Gradient Boosting models provided the most accurate predictions.

The most significant factors affecting flight price were:

✈️ Airline

📅 Date of Journey (seasonality effect)

⏳ Duration

🔀 Number of Stops

The trained model can be used by airlines and travel agencies to set competitive pricing and optimize revenue.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

🐍 Programming Language: Python

📚 Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost, LightGBM
